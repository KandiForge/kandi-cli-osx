# Closed-Source Distribution Strategy for Kandi CLI

This document outlines how to distribute kandi-cli as a **closed-source commercial product** while maintaining easy installation through Homebrew and npm.

## Distribution Model: Binary-Only Releases

### How It Works:

1. **Private Source Repository** - Your source code stays private
2. **Public Release Repository** - Contains only pre-built binaries
3. **Distribution Packages** - Homebrew tap and npm package download binaries

### Repository Structure:

```
Private Repositories (KandiForge organization):
├── kandi-cli                    # 🔒 PRIVATE - Source code
├── kandi-cli-library           # 🔒 PRIVATE - Source code
└── kandi-kit                   # 🔒 PRIVATE - Source code

Public Repositories (KandiForge organization):
├── kandi-cli-releases          # 🌍 PUBLIC - Binary releases only
├── homebrew-kandi-cli          # 🌍 PUBLIC - Homebrew tap
└── npm-kandi-cli              # 🌍 PUBLIC - npm package (optional)
```

## Step-by-Step Setup:

### 1. Create GitHub Repositories

```bash
# Create these repositories on GitHub:
# - KandiForge/kandi-cli-releases (PUBLIC) - For binary releases
# - KandiForge/homebrew-kandi-cli (PUBLIC) - Homebrew tap
# - KandiForge/kandi-cli (PRIVATE) - Source code (optional)
```

### 2. Build and Release Binaries

```bash
# Build binaries for both architectures
/Users/admin/build-and-release.sh 2.1.0

# This creates:
# - kandi-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz (Intel Macs)
# - kandi-darwin-arm64.tar.gz (Apple Silicon)
```

### 3. Upload to Release Repository

```bash
# Create release in the binary-only repository
gh repo create KandiForge/kandi-cli-releases --public
gh release create v2.1.0 --repo KandiForge/kandi-cli-releases \
  /tmp/kandi-cli-release-2.1.0/kandi-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz \
  /tmp/kandi-cli-release-2.1.0/kandi-darwin-arm64.tar.gz \
  --title "Kandi CLI v2.1.0" \
  --notes "Latest release of Kandi CLI"
```

### 4. Set Up Homebrew Distribution

```bash
# Push Homebrew tap (contains only formula, no source)
cd /Users/admin/homebrew-kandi-forge
git remote add origin https://github.com/KandiForge/homebrew-kandi-cli.git
git add .
git commit -m "Add kandi-cli formula for binary distribution"
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Set Up npm Distribution

```bash
# Publish npm package (downloads binaries, no source)
cd /Users/admin/npm-kandi-cli
npm login
npm publish --access public
```

## User Installation Experience:

### Via Homebrew:
```bash
brew tap KandiForge/kandi-cli
brew install kandi-cli
```

### Via npm:
```bash
npm install -g @KandiForge/kandi-cli
```

### What Happens During Installation:

1. **Homebrew**: Downloads pre-built binary from `kandi-cli-releases` repo
2. **npm**: Downloads package, which then downloads pre-built binary
3. **No source code** is ever downloaded to user machines
4. **No compilation** required on user machines

## Security & Legal Protection:

✅ **Source code never exposed** - Stays in private repositories  
✅ **Binary-only distribution** - Like Claude Code, Docker Desktop, etc.  
✅ **Commercial licensing** - Can charge for usage  
✅ **IP protection** - Source code cannot be reverse-engineered easily  
✅ **Professional distribution** - Through established package managers  

## Examples of This Model:

- **Claude Code**: Distributed via brew/npm, closed source
- **Docker Desktop**: Brew installable, commercial license
- **JetBrains CLion**: Binary distribution, commercial
- **Many enterprise CLI tools**: Closed source, brew/npm distributed

## Maintenance Workflow:

### For New Releases:

1. **Update version** in source code
2. **Build binaries** using `/Users/admin/build-and-release.sh`
3. **Upload to releases repo** with GitHub CLI
4. **Update package managers** (Homebrew formula, npm version)
5. **Test installation** from clean environment

### Version Management:

```bash
# Release v2.1.1
./build-and-release.sh 2.1.1

# Upload binaries
gh release create v2.1.1 --repo KandiForge/kandi-cli-releases ...

# Update Homebrew tap
# Update npm package version
```

## Repository Permissions:

### Private Source Repositories:
- Only your team has access
- Contains source code, build scripts
- No public visibility

### Public Distribution Repositories:
- Worldwide read access
- Contains only binaries and package metadata
- No source code exposed

## Cost Structure:

This model allows you to:
- **Free tier**: Limited usage, community support
- **Pro tier**: Unlimited usage, priority support
- **Enterprise**: Custom features, SLA, on-premise

## Final Structure:

```
Your Setup:
/Users/admin/
├── kandi-cli/                    # Private source (keep private)
├── homebrew-kandi-forge/         # Public tap (push to GitHub)
├── npm-kandi-cli/               # Public package (publish to npm)
└── build-and-release.sh         # Build script (keep private)

GitHub:
KandiForge/
├── kandi-cli-releases (public)   # Binary releases only
├── homebrew-kandi-cli (public)   # Homebrew tap
└── [Optional] kandi-cli (private) # Source backup
```

This gives you the same professional distribution as Claude Code while keeping your source code completely private and enabling commercial licensing.
